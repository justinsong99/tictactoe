# tictactoe
A simple React.js Tic-Tac-Toe project to learn about React.js

Initially began to write some code to start building the tic-tac-toe board and get the fucntions of the board to work. 

Main things that were worked on were, learning about and creating "states" and how JSX can help to condense and simplify Javascript syntax.

Learning about states allowed us to have a specific square "remember" what kind of state it was in before, allowing us to, in the future, change the state in each square to an 'X' so that the squares (when clicked) in the React app would portray an 'X'.

States are important because it allows us to keep child components in sync with each other and with the parent component. It helps us to "remember" things, because we are able to see the current state of the component, and then change that so that it would reflect a new "state".
