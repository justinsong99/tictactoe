A simple React.js Tic-Tac-Toe project to learn about React.js

In order to learn React.js, I decided to start a short Tic-Tac-Toe project to learn the material and get used to the syntax. I will contiuously be posting my updates and I plan to compare my project with other user's projects to get more experience with coding more efficiently with React.js.

I am using this knowledge to eventually create a React.js project that uses Node.js and a database like MongoDB to create a cloud based note sharing app for college students.
